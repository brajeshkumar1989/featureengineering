Statistical analysis is applied to the responses once they are collected to place the people who took the survey into the various categories. The data is then compared to draw inferences and conclusions about the whole surveyed population with regard to the specific variables. The advantage of using ordinal measurement is ease of collation and categoriation. If you ask a survay question without providing the variables, the answers are likely to be so diverse they cannot be converted to statistics.\n",

They survey question might lead respondents to state their dissatisfaction about the scandal in spite of satisfaction with his job performance- but the statistical conclusion will not differenciate.\n",
